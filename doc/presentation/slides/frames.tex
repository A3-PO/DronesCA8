  \begin{block}{The Presentation Theme}
    It is very simple to load the presentation theme. Just type\\
    {\tt \textbackslash usetheme[<options>]\{AAUsidebar\}}\\
    which is exactly the same way other beamer presentation themes are loaded. The presentation theme loads the inner, outer and color AAU sidebar theme files and passes the {\tt <options>} on to these files.
  \end{block}
  \begin{block}{The Inner Theme}
    You can load the inner theme directly by\\
    {\tt \textbackslash useinnertheme\{AAUsidebar\}}\\
    and it has no options.
  \end{block}
\end{frame}
