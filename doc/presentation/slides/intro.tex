\section{Introduction}
% motivation for creating this theme
\begin{frame}{Introduction}{}
  The present beamer theme called the \alert{AAU Sidebar Beamer Theme} is an attempt to
  \begin{itemize}
    \item<1-> create a simple and elegant beamer theme which can be used by students and researchers affiliated with Aalborg University (AAU),
    \item<2-> create a unique AAU theme which does not resemble any of the standard beamer themes. People should associate this theme with AAU and not with beamer,
    \item<3-> keep the amount of clutter to a minimum. Only the important things should be on the slides,
    \item<4-> retain the powerful customisation tools provided by the template system of the beamer class.
  \end{itemize}
