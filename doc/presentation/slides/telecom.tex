    \item[Overlapping footnote] You might have problems with a too wide footnote text width. This is problem with older versions of Beamer, and it can be resolved by updating Beamer to a newer version. You can read more about it in \chref{https://bitbucket.org/rivanvx/beamer/issue/200/width-of-footnote-in-a-sidebar-theme}{this bugreport}.
