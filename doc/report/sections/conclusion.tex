\section{Antennas}

\hl{Radiation paterns and gains}

\section{Servomotor}

Given the fact that the antennas dimensions are different for the GS and the UA we will have different servomotors. Such that, the parameters in each cases are as seen in \hl{Insert a table with parameters of each servomotor}.

\section{Noise}

In order to add uncertainty to the model, the Gaussian box in Simulink has been used. 

\section{Controller}

Because we account for the noise that comes from the environment the best option of this application is a PD controller instead of a PID. In the case of the PID the noise will be integrated, thus considerably increasing the error. 

\hl{Put a comparsion of the controller with noise of a PD and PID} 

\section{UAS Simulation}

Having built the model-controler-noise we can start the simulation of the whole system for further observations.
