\chapter{Controller}\label{sec:controller}
With a view to ensure a tracking communication between the drone and its ground station, and thus, keep a proper angle of the directions of the antennas, a controller has been designed.\par

The actuator to be controlled is the moving angle system, which characteristics for this application have been described in the chapter \ref{ch:model}.  Reaching speed, accuracy and weight of the antenna were taken into account to determine the appropriate system. Based on the above mentioned, different P-I-D controllers were tested.\par
