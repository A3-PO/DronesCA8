\section{Theory}

In closed loop systems, there is always a process variable which works as a system parameter that needs to be controlled. The output of these systems is measured using a sensor and its value is compared with a setpoint (reference). This feedback allows a constant monitorization of the process because the error between the reference and the process variable is used as a controller input. Then, the controller executes some calculations that will act in the plant and, depending on their type, the controller can be proportional, derivative, integral or a combination between them.

The proportional controller has its output always proportional to the error (input of the controller). This type of controllers is responsible for decreasing the rise time and the steady state error (SSE). The decrease of the rise time results from a tendency to make the system fast. The steady state error corresponds to the difference between the output and the desired value. The previous difference is proportional to the output of the controller which will also be the input of the system. The input of the system will make it perform in order to decrease the steady state error. The proportional gain, $K_c$, is inversely proportional to the SSE but, after a certain value of reduction on this error, increasing the value of $K_c$ only leads to overshoot of the system response. On the contrary, the reduction of $K_c$ prevents the elimination of the steady state error of the system.

\end{figure}

Based on the system of the figure \ref{propor_controller} and considering the plant $G(s)$ described in the equation \ref{system_equation} it is possible to calculate the characteristic equation (equations \ref{charac_equation1} and \ref{charac_prop_system}).

\begin{equation}\label{system_equation}
G(s)= \frac{A}{s^2 + a_{1}s + a_{2}}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}\label{charac_equation1}
1 + K_PG(s)=0
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}\label{charac_prop_system}
s^2 + a_{1}s + a_{2} + K_PA=0
\end{equation}

The equation \ref{charac_prop_system} shows that the designer can control the constant term $(a_{2} + K_PA)$ which determines the natural frequency but cannot control the damping term $a_{1}$ since it is independent of $K_{P}$. Therefore, the overshoot of the system response is a consequence of the lack of control of the damping term.

In addiction, these controllers provide a smaller amplitude and phase margin (the overshoot described before happens when the phase margin is too small), a faster dynamics satisfying wider frequency band and larger sensitivity to the noise (because of the proportionality between the error and the output of the controller).

The integral component, described in figure \ref{integ_controller}, sums the error term over time which means that even a small error term will increase slowly the integral component. This behaviour drives the steady state error and the steady state output response to disturbances to zero because the integral response will continually increase over time unless the error is zero. However, since the integral term responds to accumulated errors from the past, it can cause the present value to overshoot the setpoint value.

\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[scale=0.6]{figures/integ_controller.png}
	\caption{System with a integral controller}
	\label{integ_controller}
\end{figure}

Considering the same plant (equation \ref{system_equation}) it is possible to verify that the closed-loop transfer function is given by the equation \ref{int_TF} and the relation between the input and the error is defined in the equation \ref{int_error_input}.

\begin{equation}\label{int_TF}
\frac{Y(s)}{X(s)}= \frac{K_IG(s)}{s + K_IG(s)}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}\label{int_error_input}
\frac{E(s)}{X(s)}= \frac{s}{s + K_IG(s)}
\end{equation}

Using the Final Value Theorem, it is possible to calculate the error in the infinite that should be zero (the steady state error will be zero). In the equation \ref{limit_sse} it is calculated the steady state error of the system for a step input ($X(s)=\frac{1}{s}$). The result is independent of the input, which mean that, in the infinite, the error will be always zero.

\begin{equation}\label{limit_sse}
\lim_{t\to\infty} e(t) = \lim_{s \to 0} sE(s) = \lim_{s \to 0} s\frac{s}{s + K_IG(s)}\frac{1}{s} = 0
\end{equation}

The derivative feedback, also called rate feedback, is proportional to the rate of change of the system error, which means that it is calculated the slope of the error function over time. These calculations allow to have an anticipatory behaviour because the trend of the error signal is known. Thus, the stability of the closed-loop system is improved as well as the speed of the transient response and the overshoot. Derivative acts as a brake on the control effort because the more the controller tries to change the value, the more it counteracts the effort, unabling violent changes. The derivative response is also highly sensitive to noise which means that the control system can be unstable if the sensor feedback is noisy. 

\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[scale=0.6]{figures/deriv_controller.png}
	\caption{System with a derivative controller}
	\label{deriv_controller}
\end{figure}

Based on the system of the figure \ref{deriv_controller} it is possible to build the relation between the input of the system and the error between the desired value and the output one. This relation is described in the equation \ref{deri_relation}.

\begin{equation}\label{deri_relation}
\frac{U(s)}{E(s)}= sK_D
\end{equation}

The PI controller (figure \ref{PI_controller}) is constituted by a proportional and an integral part and it is mainly used to eliminate the steady state error resulting from the proportional component. However, this controller has a negative impact in the speed of the response (compared to the proportional controller) and in the stability of the system. Hence, this controller should be applied when speed is not an important parameter. Due to the PI response not predict the future errors of the system, the rise time can not be decreased and the oscillations can not be eliminated.

\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[scale=0.6]{figures/PI_controller.png}
	\caption{System with a PI controller}
	\label{PI_controller}
\end{figure}

Hence, the equation \ref{PI_equation} describes the behaviour of the PI controller.

\begin{equation}\label{PI_equation}
\frac{U(s)}{E(s)}= K_P + \frac{K_I}{s}
\end{equation}

The PD controllers (figure \ref{PD_controller}) were created because the derivative control is almost never used by itself. Hence, a proporcional term is added because the derivative does not supply information on the desired end state. In addiction, if $e(t)$ were remain constant, the output of a derivative part controller would be zero and a proportional component would be needed to provide a control signal at this time. The PD controllers are, thus, more stable than the proportional ones but they are also slower than the same ones because the derivative part prevents the sudden changes occuring.

	\centering
	\includegraphics[scale=0.6]{figures/PD_controller.png}
	\caption{System with a PD controller}
	\label{PD_controller}
\end{figure}

The PID controller collects the proportional, integral and derivative parts which allows to have a zero steady state error, a fast response, no oscillations and a higher stability. The derivative component that is added to the PI controller allows the elimination of the overshoot and the oscillations that occur in the output response of the system.

In this project it will be tested the P, PI, PD and PID controllers and it will analysed the behaviour for every case. This analyses will be done in the next section.
