\chapter{Frames}\label{ch:frames}

In navigation, guidance, and control of an aircraft or rotorcraft, there are several
coordinate systems (or frames) intensively used in design and analysis. For ease of references, in this chapter the coordinate systems adopted in this project have been summarized, which include:

\begin{itemize}
\item{The Geodetic Coordinate System}
\item{The Earth-Centered Earth-Fixed (ECEF) Coordinate System}
\item{The local North-East-Down (NED) Coordinate System}
\item{The vehicle-carried NED Coordinate System}
\item{The Body Coordinate System}
\end{itemize}

The relationships among these coordinate systems, i.e., the coordinate transformations, are also introduced. We need to point out that small UAs are normally used at low speeds in relatively small regions (non trans-oceanic travels), due to their inherent mechanical design and power limitation. This is crucial to some simplifications made in the coordinate transformation, e.g., omitting unimportant items in the transformation between the local NED frame and the body frame. For the same reason, partial transformation relationships provided in this chapter are not suitable for describing flight situations in which the rotation of the Earth is taken into account.
