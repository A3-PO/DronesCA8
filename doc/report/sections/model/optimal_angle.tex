\section{Optimal Angle}\label{sec:opt_angle}
The right part of the Figure \ref{fig:2d_system} shows two PD controllers where each of them have a servomotor connected. The PD controller is explained in Section \ref{sec:pd_controller} and the servomotor is explained in Section \ref{sec:servo_model}. The left block have two output which is $\theta\_opt\_d$ and $\theta\_opt\_gs$. They are the optimal angle that the drone and ground station need to have to be pointing at each other (Figure \ref{fig:drone_gs}). The PD controllers purpose is to make the servomotors rotate the antenna to the correct position. The PD controllers take the error ($\theta\_opt\_d - \theta\_d$) for the drone and ($\theta\_opt\_gs - \theta\_gs$) for the ground station, and make the servomotors rotate the antenna to the correct position. When the error is zero, which means the input to the PD controller is zero, the antennas are at the correct angles.
