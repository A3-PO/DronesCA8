Because we account for the noise that comes from the environment the best option of this application is a PD controller instead of a PID. In the case of the PID the noise will be integrated, thus considerably increasing the error. 

\hl{Put a comparsion of the controller with noise of a PD and PID} 

\hl{Compare effects of controller on 3D simulations (angles/gains)}
