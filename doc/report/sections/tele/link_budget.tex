\section{Link Budget}\label{subsec:link_budget}
\paragraph{}
A link budget is accounting of all of the gains and losses from the transmitter, through the medium  to the receiver in a telecommunication system. It accounts for the attenuation of the transmitted signal due to propagation, as well as the antenna gains, feedline and miscellaneous losses. 
\begin{equation*}\label{eq:link_budget} 
 		\text{Received Power (dBm)} = \text{Transmitted Power (dBm)} + \text{Gains (dB)} - \text{Losses(dB)}
\end{equation*}

In more detailed a common radio link looks like this:

\begin{equation*}\label{eq:link_budget} 
 		P_{RX} = P_{TX} + G_{TX} - L_{TX} - L_{FS} - L_{M} + G_{RX} - L_{RX}
\end{equation*}

Note that decibels are logarithmic measurements, so adding decibels is equivalent to multiplying the actual numeric ratios.

\subsection{Free Space Path Loss}\label{subsec:path_loss}
\paragraph{}
The free space path loss (FSPL) is the loss in signal strength that occurs when an electromagnetic wave travels over a line of sight path in free space. In these circumstances there are no obstacles that might cause the signal to be reflected, refracted, or that might cause additional attenuation. Equation \ref{eq:path_losses} represents the loss in signal strength in dB.

\begin{equation}\label{eq:path_losses}
	L_{FS} = 20\lg\left (\frac{4\pi \cdot d}{\lambda} \right)
\end{equation}

The wave length can also be described by a relationship between the frequency and the velocity of light. This relationship is described by the equation \ref{eq:vel_freq_wavelen1}.

\begin{equation}\label{eq:vel_freq_wavelen1}
	\lambda = \frac{c}{f}
\end{equation}

Explanation of the parameters.
\begin{itemize}
	\item d - distance from transmitter to receiver [m]
	\item $\lambda$ - wavelength of the signal [m]
	\item c - speed of light constant $3\cdot 10^8$ [m/s] 
	\item f - frequency of signal [Hz]
\end{itemize}

Considering our problem we will look into the worst case scenario, which would be the maximum distance between GS and UAV. 
\begin{equation*}
	Assume 
	\begin{cases}
	d_{max} = \sqrt{x^2+y^2}\\
	\text{f} = f\text{GHz (Should be permitted by law})\\
	\end{cases}
\end{equation*}

Computing signal wavelength:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:vel_freq_wavelen2}
	\lambda = \frac{c}{f} 
	        = \frac{3\cdot 10^{8}}{f\cdot 10^{9}}
	        = \frac{3}{10f}m
\end{equation}

Computing path loss:
\begin{align*}\label{eq:path_loses_calc}
	L = 20\lg\left (\frac{4\pi d}{\lambda} \right) dB 
	 &= 20\lg\left (\frac{4\pi \sqrt{x^2+y^2}}{\frac{3}{10f}} \right) dB\\ 
	 &= 20\lg\left (\frac{4\pi \sqrt{x^2+y^2}\cdot 10f}{ 3} \right) dB
\end{align*}
\noindent \textbf{As an observation, higher distance value between GS and UAV will result in higher path loss.}
