\section{Ground Station}\label{sec:gs}

The ground station is, generally, a terrestrial radio station designed for planetary and extraplanetary telecommunication with aircrafts and spacecrafts, respectively. For planetary telecommunications, the ground station is located on the surface of the Earth and they communicate with the aircrafts by transmitting and receiving radio waves in a specific band of the spectrum.

In this case, the ground station is prepared to control the UAV using an antenna to communicate and a computer to analyse the received data and to send some commands to the aircraft.
