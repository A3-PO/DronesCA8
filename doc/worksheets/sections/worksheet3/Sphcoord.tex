\subsection*{Spherical Coordinate System}

In mathematics, a spherical coordinate system is a coordinate system for three-dimensional space where the position of a point is specified by three numbers: the \textbf{radial distance} of that point from a fixed origin ($\rho$), its \textbf{polar angle} measured from a fixed zenith direction ($\theta$), and the \textbf{elevation angle} of its orthogonal projection on a reference plane, measured from a fixed reference direction on that plane ($\phi$).

 It is necessary to define a unique set of spherical coordinates for each point, and therefore restricting their range is required. In our case the coordinates will be limited as follows:
\begin{align*}
& \rho \geq 0 \\
& -\pi \leq \theta < \pi \\
& \frac{-\pi}{2} \leq \phi \leq \frac{\pi}{2}
\label{eq:los_distToHorizon}
\end{align*} 

These constraints define the conversion between Cartesian and Spherical coordinates such that:
\begin{align*}
x &=  \rho\cos\phi\cos\theta	&	\rho &= \sqrt{x^{2} + y^{2} + z^{2}} \\
y &= \rho\cos\phi\sin\theta		&	\theta &= \text{atan2}\left(\frac{y}{x}\right)\\
z &= \rho\sin\phi				&	\phi &=  \text{atan2}\left(\frac{z}{\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}}\right)
\label{eq:los_distToHorizon}
\end{align*} 

\subsection*{Simulation 3D}
Once the coordinate system has been defined the general scenario of the project will be introduced.

where ($x_d,y_d,z_d$) are the coordinates that describe the position of the drone and ($x_{gs},y_{gs},z_{gs}$) are the coordinates that describe the position of the ground station.

The \textbf{Line Of Sight} (LOS) distance is then given by the former defined variable $\rho$ and the \textbf{LOS angles} are given by the former defined variables $\theta$ and $\phi$.

The drone and the ground station will have their antennas pointing vector which, generally, will not be equal to the optimal angles. It is precisely our main task in this project to design a controller than drives these antennas to point to each other and, that way, we can get the best performance in the radio-communication link.

These angles will be referred during the rest of the text as \textit{optimal angles} or \textit{reference angles}.
